title: NixOS, Pandoc and Hakyll
---

## My setup

Since Hakyll sites are generated by Haskell programs, I thought I would
just use the Haskell ecosystem in NixOS to build my program, and then override
the `installPhase` with something that executes the program and copies the
site files to the correct location. Following the instructions in the
[NixOS User Guide](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#users-guide-to-the-haskell-infrastructure),
I generate the main `nix` file with `cabal2nix` and manually add the `default.nix`
and `shell.nix` files. I then make a small change to the `themk.net.nix`
file generated by `cabal2nix`.

#### themk.net.nix
``` nix
{ mkDerivation, base, hakyll, stdenv }:
mkDerivation {
  pname = "themk-net";
  version = "0.1.0.0";
  src = ./.;
  isLibrary = false;
  isExecutable = true;
  executableHaskellDepends = [ base hakyll ];
  license = stdenv.lib.licenses.bsd3;

  # ------- Change is here -------------------
  # Override the installPhase to execute the
  # program, and copy the results to $out
  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out
    ./dist/build/site/site build
    cp -a _site/* $out
  '';
}
```

We can now use this package from within `configuration.nix` to set
up `httpd` to point to our new derivation. In order to do this we
need to determine the sha256 hash of the commit we are interested in.
To do this, use the command

    nix-prefetch-git <git url> <commit hash>

Here are the relevant parts of my configuration.nix

#### configuration.nix
```nix
let
  sitesrc = pkgs.fetchgit {
    url = https://github.com/luke-clifton/themk.net.git; 
    rev = "623f2e60193d0351234df1a3a6a4161badffd668"; 
    sha256 = "1cb0f50c085ec2d25231992799a29c5d15c4ebae6da8e3ef3cf5abe0f5d80d84"; 
  }; 
  site = pkgs.callPackage "${sitesrc}" {}
in {
  # ...
 
  services.httpd = {
      adminAddr = "webmaster@themk.net";
      enable = true;
      hostName = "themk.net";
      documentRoot = "${site}";
    };

  # ...
}
```
