<h2>Historic Notes</h2>

<p>Old notes that I found lying around. All of them are probably from
around 2012, probably reference an embedded Linux distribution that
is even older, and none of them have been tested before being uploaded
here. If I ever need to reference them again myself, I may update them
and promote them to a proper post.</p>
