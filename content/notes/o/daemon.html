<h1>Daemons in in <code>init</code></h1>

<p>See systemd note for details on how to do this with systemd</p>

<p>A proper daemon would do a lot of work to make sure that it is the only one running, to make sure that it forks and does all the proper daemony things, but you can cheat a lot by using a program called <code>start-stop-daemon</code>.</p>
<p>Simply write a regular program and make an init.d script that starts it and stops it like this</p>
<p>to start use</p>
<pre><code>start-stop-daemon --start --exec python \
    --startas /home/root/sampler/sampler.py \
    --make-pid --pidfile /path/to/sampler.pid -b</code></pre>
<p>the <code>--start</code> tells it to start it, the <code>--exec</code> option says that the prgram that is started will be an instance of python (to find out what you should put here, start your program normally, determine its PID (with <code>ps</code>) and do an</p>
<pre><code>ls -l /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe</code></pre>
<p>This will show you what is really being run (e.g. <code>/usr/bin/python</code>)) The <code>--startas</code> options tells it which command to run to start the process. <code>--make-pid</code> tells it to make a pid-file which it will use later on to see if the process is still running. <code>--pidfile</code> tells it where to put the pidfile and <code>-b</code> tells it to &quot;background&quot; the task.</p>
<p>To stop use</p>
<pre><code>start-stop-daemon --stop --exec python --pidfile /path/to/sampler.pid</code></pre>
<p>This process will ensure that only a single instance of your prgram is running at any given time (it uses the PID file and the value of <code>--exec</code> to know whether or not your program is running).</p>
<p>Have a look at the example <code>init.d</code> script that launches a python script as a daemon</p>
