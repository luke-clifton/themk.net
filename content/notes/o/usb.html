<h2>Which device am I using?</h2>
<p>Use udev rules to SYMLINK a device based on its USB parameters. Usually link to <code>/dev/modem</code> or <code>/dev/angle_encoder</code> etc.</p>
<p>Rules can be based on anything in</p>
<pre><code>udevadm info -a -n ttyUSB1</code></pre>
<p>with the only rule being you can only look at the values from the main device and a single (any) parent.</p>
<p>Rules are written into <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules</code> The 10 makes it more important than the default rules (which I think have a priority of 50). The <code>.rules</code> ending is required.</p>
<p>For example, to get the Sierra module working, and always mounting the modem port at <code>/dev/modem</code> I used the rules</p>
<pre><code>DRIVERS==&quot;sierra&quot;, ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}==&quot;02&quot;, SYMLINK+=&quot;modem&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The Sierra module brings up 4 interfaces (which can bee seen in <code>dmesg</code>) and you had to guess and check to figure out which interface number the correct one corresponded to. Once you knew which <code>/dev/ttyUSB*</code> corresponded to the modems communication channel you had to do a</p>
<pre><code>udevadm info -a -n ttyUSB1
udevadm info -a -n ttyUSB2
udevadm info -a -n ttyUSB3
udevadm info -a -n ttyUSB4</code></pre>
<p>and check the differences.</p>
<p>Once the rules are established any device plugging/unplugging should see those rules. But do see the next section.</p>

<section id="my-udev-rules-dont-work-on-boot" class="level2">
<h2>My udev rules don't work on boot!</h2>
<p>Currently udev starts AFTER the devices have been registered by the kernel. You can make udev rerun all its rules with this</p>
<pre><code>udevadm trigger</code></pre>
<p>For SECRET_PROJECT_E I have added an init.d script that runs really late in the boot process and simlpy calls that. Ideally we should make udev start earlier. I don't know how to do this yet.</p>

<section id="my-usb-device-is-frozen" class="level2">
<h2>My USB device is frozen?!</h2>
<p>Each usb device should have a entry in lsusb. Look for the fields that look like</p>
<pre><code>1d6b:0002
0458:0007
0403:6001</code></pre>
<p>The first number is the vendor id, the second is the product id.</p>
<p>You can restart a usb device by using usb_modeswitch</p>
<pre><code>usb_modeswitch -R -v &lt;vendor_id&gt; -p &lt;product_id&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if you can distinguish between multiple identical products that are plugged in.</p>
